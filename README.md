- **TX/RX Control**: Handles transmission switching for JS8Call
- **VU Meter Support**: Visual transmission feedback during operation  
- **CAT Command Forwarding**: Transparent command passing between JS8Call and radio
- **Robust Error Handling**: Multiple retry attempts with comprehensive debugging
- **Auto-detection**: Automatically finds TruSDX USB device

## Quick Start

### Method 1: Pip Installation (Recommended)

1. **Install from source:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/milton-tanaka/trusdx-ai.git
   cd trusdx-ai
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Run the driver:**
   ```bash
   trusdx-ai
   ```

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

2. **Run the driver:**
   ```bash
   python3 trusdx-txrx-AI.py
   ```

### Method 3: Pre-built Binaries

1. **Download the binary** from the [releases page](https://github.com/milton-tanaka/trusdx-ai/releases/tag/v1.2.0)
2. **Make it executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x trusdx-ai-v1.2.0
   ./trusdx-ai-v1.2.0
   ```

## Windows vs. Linux Feature Comparison

| Feature | Windows Implementation | Linux Implementation | Notes |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------|---------|
| **Audio Routing** | VB-Audio Virtual Audio Cable | PulseAudio null-sink | Linux uses native audio subsystem |
| **CAT Bridging** | com0com virtual COM ports | PTY (pseudo-terminal) | Linux uses native device files |
| **PTT Control** | Manual virtual device setup | Integrated CAT/VOX | Linux has built-in support |
| **Installation** | Multiple manual driver installs | Single setup script | Linux requires fewer dependencies |
| **Virtual Devices** | Third-party drivers required | Native OS support | Linux advantage |
| **Audio Latency** | Dependent on VB-Audio | Direct PulseAudio access | Linux potentially lower latency |
| **System Integration** | External dependencies | Native integration | Linux more tightly integrated |

### Windows-Only Dependencies (Not applicable on Linux)

- **VB-Audio Virtual Audio Cable**: Linux uses PulseAudio null-sink instead
- **com0com**: Linux uses PTY for virtual serial ports  
- **Driver signing workarounds**: Not needed on Linux
- **Manual COM port configuration**: Linux auto-configures device files

### Linux Equivalents for Windows Features

- **Audio routing**: `pactl load-module module-null-sink` replaces VB-Audio
- **Virtual serial ports**: `socat` and PTY replace com0com
- **Device permissions**: `udev` rules replace Windows driver installation
- **Audio control**: PulseAudio mixer replaces Windows audio control panel
