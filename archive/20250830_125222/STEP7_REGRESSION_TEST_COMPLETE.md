# Step 7: Regression Test - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary

Successfully created automated regression testing suite for the truSDX driver that simulates WSJT-X operation and verifies driver stability.

## Created Files

1. **`regression_test.sh`** - Full interactive regression test
   - Simulates WSJT-X with dummy `arecord`/`aplay` using `*_app` devices
   - Tests driver stability for 2+ minutes
   - Performs 5 stream start/stop cycles to verify reconnection logic
   - Detects crashes, "Device unavailable" errors, and Python tracebacks
   - Provides colored terminal output with detailed progress

2. **`ci_regression_test.sh`** - CI/CD optimized test
   - Lightweight version for automated pipelines
   - GitHub Actions/GitLab CI compatible
   - Generates JUnit XML reports
   - Auto-installs dependencies in CI environment

3. **`.github/workflows/regression_test.yml`** - GitHub Actions workflow
   - Runs on push, PR, and nightly
   - Tests multiple Python versions
   - Publishes test results
   - Creates issues on failure

4. **`REGRESSION_TEST_README.md`** - Complete documentation
   - Usage instructions
   - CI/CD integration examples
   - Troubleshooting guide

## Test Features

### What the Test Does

1. **Launches dummy audio streams**:
   - `aplay -D trusdx_tx_app` - Simulates WSJT-X transmitting audio
   - `arecord -D trusdx_rx_app` - Simulates WSJT-X receiving audio

2. **Starts the driver**:
   - Runs `trusdx-txrx-AI.py` in background
   - Monitors for successful initialization

3. **Performs stability checks**:
   - Monitors driver for 2 minutes without crash
   - Checks for "Device unavailable" errors
   - Detects Python tracebacks

4. **Tests reconnection logic**:
   - Starts/stops audio streams 5 times
   - Verifies driver recovers from disconnections
   - Ensures no crashes during reconnection

5. **CI passes if**:
   - Driver remains alive for entire test duration
   - No "Device unavailable" tracebacks detected
   - All stream reconnection cycles complete successfully

## How to Run

### Quick Test
```bash
# Run the regression test
./regression_test.sh
```

### CI Test
```bash
# Run CI-friendly version
./ci_regression_test.sh
```

### Expected Output (Success)
```
=== truSDX Driver Regression Test ===
✅ ALSA Loopback card available
✅ Found trusdx_tx_app device
✅ Found trusdx_rx_app device
✅ Dummy audio streams started
✅ Driver started successfully (PID: 12345)
✅ Driver healthy for 30 seconds
✅ Driver survived stream restart cycle 1
✅ Driver survived stream restart cycle 2
✅ Driver survived stream restart cycle 3
✅ Driver survived stream restart cycle 4
✅ Driver survived stream restart cycle 5
✅ Driver healthy for 30 seconds

=== TEST REPORT ===
Results:
  Successful checks: 9
  Errors found: 0

✅ ✅ ✅ REGRESSION TEST PASSED ✅ ✅ ✅
```

## Integration with CI/CD

The test can be integrated into any CI/CD pipeline:

- **Exit code 0**: Test passed
- **Exit code 1**: Test failed
- **Exit code 77**: Test skipped (missing dependencies)

### GitHub Actions
```yaml
- name: Run regression test
  run: ./ci_regression_test.sh
```

### GitLab CI
```yaml
test:
  script:
    - ./ci_regression_test.sh
  artifacts:
    reports:
      junit: logs/test_results.xml
```

### Jenkins
```groovy
sh './ci_regression_test.sh'
junit 'logs/test_results.xml'
```

## Test Logs

All test logs are saved in `./logs/`:
- `regression_test_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` - Main test log
- `trusdx_driver_test.log` - Driver output during test
- `test_results.xml` - JUnit format (CI only)

## Success Criteria Met ✅

1. ✅ **Dummy audio streams** using `arecord`/`aplay` with `*_app` devices
2. ✅ **Driver starts and runs** for 2+ minutes without crash
3. ✅ **Stream reconnection** tested with 5 start/stop cycles
4. ✅ **Error detection** for "Device unavailable" and tracebacks
5. ✅ **CI-friendly** with proper exit codes and JUnit output

## Next Steps

The regression test is now ready to:
- Run manually for local testing
- Integrate into CI/CD pipelines
- Run automatically on code changes
- Provide early detection of driver issues

To run the test now:
```bash
./regression_test.sh
```

The test will automatically:
1. Check prerequisites
2. Start dummy WSJT-X simulation
3. Launch the driver
4. Monitor for 2+ minutes
5. Test reconnection logic
6. Report PASS/FAIL status
