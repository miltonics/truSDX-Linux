# Step 4: Audio-Path Issue Resolution - COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully resolved the audio-path issue by implementing auto-loading of `module-null-sink`, updating the driver to use proper TRUSDX audio devices, and providing comprehensive utilities for audio connection management.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Driver Side Enhancements

#### Auto-load module-null-sink
- Modified `check_audio_setup()` function to automatically load `module-null-sink` named **TRUSDX** if missing
- Added verbose logging with module ID when sink is created
- Improved error handling and user feedback

#### Updated Audio Device Handling
- Changed from generic "pipewire" to specific devices:
  - **in_stream**: Uses `TRUSDX` sink (receives audio from JS8Call)
  - **out_stream**: Uses `TRUSDX.monitor` (sends audio to JS8Call)
- Enhanced `find_audio_device()` to properly identify and select TRUSDX devices
- Added verbose mode output showing device indices

#### Code Changes in trusdx-txrx-AI.py:
```python
# Updated platform config
'virtual_audio_dev_out': "TRUSDX",         # Sink for output
'virtual_audio_dev_in': "TRUSDX.monitor",  # Monitor for input

# Enhanced audio device finding with verbose output
if config.get('verbose', False):
    print(f"[AUDIO] Found TRUSDX.monitor (input) - index: {i}")
    print(f"[AUDIO] Found TRUSDX (output) - index: {i}")
```

### 2. PipeWire/Pulse Utilities

#### trusdx-audio-connect.sh
Created comprehensive CLI utility with features:
- **Interactive menu** for easy audio routing
- **Automatic TRUSDX sink creation**
- **Application connection** (JS8Call, WSJT-X, FLDigi)
- **Connection verification** using pw-link and pactl
- **Audio testing** with parecord
- **Command-line mode** for scripting

Usage examples:
```bash
# Interactive mode
./trusdx-audio-connect.sh

# Direct connection
./trusdx-audio-connect.sh connect js8call

# Verify connections
./trusdx-audio-connect.sh verify

# Test audio recording
./trusdx-audio-connect.sh test
```

### 3. JS8Call Configuration

#### Updated README.md
Added clear instructions for JS8Call audio setup:
- **Audio Input**: Select "TRUSDX.monitor"
- **Audio Output**: Select "TRUSDX"

### 4. Automated Testing

#### test_audio_path.py
Created comprehensive automated test that:
- Generates 1kHz test tone WAV file
- Plays tone through TRUSDX sink
- Monitors audio levels in real-time
- Records from TRUSDX.monitor
- Analyzes recording for signal presence
- Provides clear pass/fail results

#### monitor_audio_pw-top.sh
Simple wrapper script to demonstrate pw-top usage for monitoring TRUSDX audio flow.

## Verification Commands

### Manual verification with parecord:
```bash
# Record 5 seconds from TRUSDX.monitor
parecord --device=TRUSDX.monitor -d 5 test.wav

# Check file size (should be > 0)
ls -la test.wav

# Play back recording
paplay test.wav
```

### Check with pw-top:
```bash
# Monitor real-time audio flow
pw-top
# Look for TRUSDX nodes and check RATE column for activity
```

### Verify sink exists:
```bash
# List all sinks
pactl list sinks | grep -A5 "Name: TRUSDX"

# Get sink info
pactl get-sink-volume TRUSDX
```

## Testing Results

1. **Auto-load functionality**: ✅ Driver automatically creates TRUSDX sink on startup
2. **Device indices**: ✅ Printed in verbose mode for debugging
3. **Audio routing**: ✅ JS8Call can send/receive audio through TRUSDX devices
4. **parecord test**: ✅ Successfully records non-zero WAV files
5. **pw-top monitoring**: ✅ Shows audio activity on TRUSDX nodes
6. **Automated test**: ✅ test_audio_path.py validates complete audio path

## Files Created/Modified

1. **trusdx-txrx-AI.py** - Enhanced with proper audio device handling
2. **trusdx-audio-connect.sh** - New utility for audio connection management
3. **test_audio_path.py** - Automated audio path testing
4. **monitor_audio_pw-top.sh** - pw-top demonstration script
5. **README.md** - Updated with JS8Call audio configuration

## Next Steps

With the audio path fully resolved, the system is ready for:
- Production use with JS8Call
- Extended testing with other digital mode applications
- Integration into automated deployment scripts

The audio subsystem now provides reliable, automated connectivity between the truSDX hardware and digital mode applications.
