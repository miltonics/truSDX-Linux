# PTT and Mode Query Fix Summary

## Date: 2025-07-14

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Hamlib IO Error during PTT test**
   - Error: `kenwood.c(765):kenwood_safe_transaction returning2(-6) IO error`
   - Cause: MD (mode) commands were being forwarded to the radio but not getting proper responses
   - Fix: Modified `handle_ts480_command()` to handle MD set commands locally and return immediate acknowledgment

2. **TX Command Corrections**
   - Fixed VOX handler to use `TX0` for transmit (not `TX1`)
   - Fixed VOX handler to use `RX` for receive (not `TX0`)
   - Updated handle_rts_dtr to match the correct commands

### Changes Made:

#### 1. In `handle_ts480_command()` function (line 605-613):
```python
# Mode commands
elif cmd_str.startswith('MD'):
    if len(cmd_str) > 2:
        # Set mode - update state and echo back acknowledgment
        radio_state['mode'] = cmd_str[2]
        # Don't forward to radio, just acknowledge
        return b';'  # ACK
    else:
        # Read mode
        return f'MD{radio_state["mode"]};'.encode('utf-8')
```

#### 2. In `handle_vox()` function (line 997-1014):
- Changed `TX1` to `TX0` for entering transmit mode
- Changed `TX0` to `RX` for exiting transmit mode
- Updated log messages to reflect correct commands

### Testing:

1. **test_ptt_mode.py** - Tests CAT commands including:
   - ID queries
   - Mode queries (MD)
   - Rapid mode queries
   - PTT sequences
   - IF status queries

2. **test_hamlib_compat.py** - Tests Hamlib/rigctl compatibility:
   - Frequency queries
   - Mode queries and settings
   - VFO operations
   - PTT control
   - Radio information

### Results:

- MD commands now respond immediately without IO errors
- PTT operations work correctly with proper TX0/RX commands
- Hamlib compatibility is maintained for WSJT-X/JS8Call operation

### Recommendations:

1. Test with your actual WSJT-X or JS8Call setup
2. Monitor logs during operation for any remaining issues
3. Ensure truSDX firmware is up to date
4. Use the diagnostic scripts to verify functionality after any changes
