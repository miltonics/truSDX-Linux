## Problem Statement
0 W during TX / no RX recovery - TX1 command causing driver crashes

## Proposed Fix #2
- Send UA1 BEFORE forwarding TX1 to hardware
- Fix command processing order in handle_cat() function
- Handle stream errors during reconnection

## Implementation
### Code Changes Summary

1. **TX1 Command Handler Fix** (trusdx-txrx-AI.py lines 1085-1097)
   - Moved TX1 handling BEFORE the command is forwarded to radio
   - Now sends UA1 command BEFORE TX1 is sent to hardware
   - Prevents radio crash due to missing audio enable command
   - Sets TX state and restarts audio streams before forwarding

2. **Previous Fixes Still Active**:
   - TX Command Standardization (lines 708-713)
   - UA0 Command After TX (lines 961-970)
   - VOX Handler Update (lines 971-983)
   - RTS/DTR Handler Update (lines 984-996)
   - CAT Command Timing (lines 946-959)

3. **Enable CAT Audio Function** (lines 976-983)
   - Function sends UA1 command to enable CAT audio ahead of transmission
   - Called in `handle_vox()` at line 989 when TX is triggered by audio
   - Called in `handle_rts_dtr()` at line 1006 when TX is triggered by RTS/DTR
   - **NEW**: Called in `handle_cat()` at line 1090 BEFORE TX1 is forwarded

## Testing
### Test Results Summary

1. **TX1 Command Processing Fix**
   - Successfully sends UA1 before TX1 command
   - Log output confirms: "[TX] Enabling CAT audio (UA1) before TX1..."
   - UA1 command sent with proper timing
   - TX1 then forwarded to truSDX hardware

2. **Issues Identified**:
   - **0W Power Issue**: Despite UA1 being sent, radio still reports 0W
   - **Stream Errors**: OSError [Errno -9988] during reconnection
   - **Driver Crash**: Connection lost after ~2 seconds in TX mode

### Testing Log Excerpt

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ TX1 command handling fixed - UA1 now sent BEFORE TX1
- ‚ùå Radio still showing 0W power during TX
- ‚ùå Driver crashes after entering TX mode
- ‚ùå Stream handling errors during reconnection

## Next Steps
1. Investigate why UA1 command is not enabling audio properly
2. Check if additional initialization is needed before TX
3. Fix stream handling during reconnection
4. Consider hardware-specific requirements for truSDX

## Future Work
- Investigate truSDX-specific CAT command requirements
- Improve stream error handling during reconnection
- Add more robust TX state management
- Consider implementing TX power query before/after UA1
