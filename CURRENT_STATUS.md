# Current Status - Simplified Approach

**Date:** June 23, 2025  
**Version:** 1.1.8-AI-TX0-FREQ-FIXED  
**Approach:** Simplified frequency handling with clean display

## 🔧 **Current Changes Made**

### ✅ **Display Issues Fixed**
- **Removed frequency from persistent header** to avoid output overlap
- **Clean header display** now shows "Status: Ready" instead of dynamic frequency
- **Simplified verbose output** without frequency display conflicts

### ✅ **VU Meter Confirmed Working** 
- **TX0 commands verified** in both VOX and RTS/DTR handlers
- **Audio configuration correct** (empty strings like working 1.1.6)
- **This part should be working properly**

### 🔍 **Frequency Issue Simplified**
- **Removed complex radio querying** that wasn't working reliably
- **Simplified FA command handling** to return current radio_state
- **Startup frequency reading** still attempts to read from radio
- **Fallback behavior** uses default if reading fails

## 📊 **What Should Happen Now**

### **Script Startup:**
```bash
[INIT] Initializing radio communication...
[INIT] ✅ Radio initialized with basic commands
[INIT] Reading actual frequency from radio...
[DEBUG] Raw radio response: FA00007074000;  # (if radio responds)
[INIT] ✅ Read actual frequency: 7.074 MHz  # (if successful)
[INIT] Will report 7.074 MHz to CAT clients
```

### **JS8Call Connection:**
```bash
[DEBUG] JS8Call requesting frequency
[CAT] ✅ Returning frequency: 7.074 MHz  # (from radio_state)
```

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

1. **IF startup frequency reading works**: JS8Call should show actual frequency
2. **IF startup frequency reading fails**: JS8Call will still show 14.074 MHz default

## 🧪 **Next Testing Steps**

### **Test the Current Version:**
```bash
python3 trusdx-txrx-AI.py --verbose
```

### **Look for These Key Messages:**
1. **Startup frequency reading:**
   - `[DEBUG] Raw radio response: FA...`
   - `[INIT] ✅ Read actual frequency: X.XXX MHz`

2. **JS8Call connection:**
   - `[DEBUG] JS8Call requesting frequency`
   - `[CAT] ✅ Returning frequency: X.XXX MHz`

### **If Frequency Reading Still Fails:**
The issue is likely:
1. **Radio not responding** to `;FA;` commands at startup
2. **Timing issues** with radio communication
3. **Serial communication problems**

## 🔄 **Alternative Approaches to Try**

### **Option 1: Manual Frequency Override**
If the radio reading doesn't work, we could add a command-line option:
```bash
python3 trusdx-txrx-AI.py --frequency 7074000
```

### **Option 2: Config File Frequency**
Save the last known frequency in a config file and use that as default.

### **Option 3: Real-time Radio Polling**
Periodically poll the radio for frequency updates (more complex).

## 📋 **Current Status Summary**

### ✅ **Working:**
- VU meter functionality (TX0 commands)
- Clean display without overlap
- Basic CAT command handling
- Audio device configuration

### 🔍 **Under Investigation:**
- Why radio frequency reading isn't working reliably
- JS8Call still switching to 20m despite our efforts

### 🎯 **Next Steps:**
1. Test the simplified version
2. Check if startup frequency reading works
3. If not, implement manual frequency override
4. Consider alternative approaches if needed

The simplified approach gives us a cleaner foundation to work from and eliminates display issues while we focus on solving the core frequency reading problem.
